    <h1>Git</h1>
    <p>Git (/ɡɪt/)[8] is a distributed version control system[9] that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different computers).[10][11][12]
        Git was originally authored by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.[13] Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.[14] Git is free and open-source software shared under the GPL-2.0-only license.

    <h1>Github</h1>
    <p>GitHub (/ˈɡɪthʌb/[a]) is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. It uses Git software, providing the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.[7] Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.[8]
        It is commonly used to host open source software development projects.[9] As of January 2023, GitHub reported having over 100 million developers[10] and more than 420 million repositories,[11] including at least 28 million public repositories.[12] It is the world's largest source code host as of June 2023.
